# Geofencing Web App

## Overview
This project is a **Geofencing Web Application** built using **Node.js** and **React.js**. The app tracks the user's location in real-time using the **GPS Watch Position API**. When the user enters or exits predefined geofences, an alert is triggered. Additionally, the app allows the user to send an **SOS alert** to their predefined emergency contacts, delivering their current location via WhatsApp, integrated with a **Google Maps link**.
